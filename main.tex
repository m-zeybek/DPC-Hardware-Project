 \tab Considering that using Forward Converter topology instead of Flyback Converter increases cost, we aimed to come up with a more efficient converter instead of cheaper converter since using this topology already increases cost and it may not be possible to offer cheapest solution to the customers. Minimizing volume also was not our primary concern since the topology has transformer which makes its volume larger than non-isolated converter topologies such as Buck converter, Cuk converter.

\section*{Design Decisions}
\tab Since we aim to make our circuit as efficient as possible, some of the design decisions that we took in the Simulation Report are revised. We tried to make core loss and copper loss of magnetizing elements as close as possible since we assume it is the ideal and most efficient case. Semiconductor devices are also revised to minimize losses on them. Output capacitor is also replaced with several parallel capacitors so that we can minimize ESR value.
\subsection*{1) Magnetic Design}
\tab\textbf{a) Transformer Design} \\
\tab Firstly, we selected our switching frequency. We selected it as 10 kHz. Although it is relatively small value for that kind of application, it decreases losses which is our main goal. Then we calculated our desired area product for the transformer considering our design specifications as follows, where $P_{out}$ is output power, J is current density, K is topology constant, $B_{max}$ is maximum flux density and f is frequency:

 \begin{equation*}
     W_aA_c=\frac{P_{out}J}{K B_{max} f}=\frac{48*500}{0.0005*1300*10*10^3}=3.69 cm^4
 \end{equation*}
 \tab Since we desire to have a high permeability core for Forward Converter, ferrite cores fit better for our application. Considering these, \href{https://www.mag-inc.com/Media/Magnetics/Datasheets/0P44022EC.pdf}{0P44022EC} is selected. It is an E shaped, P material type ferrite core, whose area product is $4.59 cm^4$. \\
 \tab After that, we calculated our required primary number of turns for the transformer as follows:
 \begin{equation*}
    n_1>\frac{V_i_{max}*D_{max}}{f_s*B_{sat}*A_e}=\frac{24*0.5}{10^4*0.3*0.000233}=17.167
\end{equation*}
$n_1$ is selected as 18. Considering we always need to stay below 0.5 duty cycle so that we do not saturate the core and considering additional voltage losses in realistic simulation, we calculated $n_3$ $ \frac{n_3}{n_1}=1.2$. As a result, $n_3$ is selected as 22. $n_2$ is selected as 18 as well, equal to $n_1$. After that, appropriate cable sizes are selected for each winding for current density of $4 A/mm^2$. Maximum input current is assumed to be 2.08 A and output current is assumed to be 5 A considering power and voltage ratings. As a result, AWG18 for primary side, AWG14 for secondary side and AWG25 for reset winding is selected. Fill factor is calculated to whether we can fit these cables inside the core or not as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    k_f=\frac{A_{cable}}{A_e}=\frac{((18*0.82+22*2.08+18*0.16) mm^2}{233 mm^2}=0.272
\end{equation*}
Fill factor is relatively small, on the other hand it shows that cables can fit into the core and having a large core can help us reduce core losses. \\
\tab Copper losses are calculated with selected cable sizes. To do that, mean length per turn value was necessary, which is calculated as below for E shaped transformer:
\begin{equation*}
    MLT=\frac{ \pi*(E-F)}{4}= 13.59 mm
\end{equation*}

After that, primary and secondary winding resistances are found as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    R_{1}=20.9428*18*13.59*10^{-6}=5.123 mOhms
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    R_{3}=8.282*22*13.59*10^{-6}=2.476 mOhms
\end{equation*}

Using $I^2R$ formula, copper loss is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    P_{copper}=I_1^2R_1+I_3^2R_3=2.08^2*5.123*10^{-3}+5^2*2.476*10^{-3}=84 mW
\end{equation*}

\tab To calculate core loss, Steinmetz's Equation is used. It is specified as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    P_{CL}=\frac{a*f^x*B^y*L(T)}{1000} mW/cm^3
\end{equation*}
\tab To use this equation, a, x and y constants, which are material specific, are needed. For P type material Magnetics provided these values as $a=3.2$, $x=1.46$ and $y=2.75$. L(T) is also a function of ambient temperature and it is given as $1$ for $100 Celcius$ temperature. It is assumed to be 1 in the calculation:
\begin{equation*}
     P_{CL}=\frac{3.2*(10*10^3)^{1.46}*0.3^2.75}{1000}=137.91 mW/cm^3
\end{equation*}
Multipliying it with $V_e$ of the core which is $5590 mm^3$, we can find $P_{core}$ as follows:

\begin{equation*}
   P_{core}=P_{CL}*V_e=137.91*22.7=3.13 W
\end{equation*}
\tab\textbf{b) Inductor Design}
\newline \tab At inductor design, we want to limit output current ripple which would also ensure continuous conduction mode. We want to keep the converter in CCM since forward converter's gain changes a lot in DCM. On the other hand, choosing a too large inductor would increase DCR value, which would reduce efficiency. We considered following equations for calculation of our output inductor considering 2 \% ripple rating:
\begin{equation*}
    I_{L_O,min}=I_{O,max}*0.02 =4.8*0.02=0.096 A
\end{equation*}
Ripple value must be less than twice of this value which is given below:
\begin{equation*}
{\displaystyle \Delta }I_{L_o}=(\frac{n_3}{n_1}*V_i-V_o)*\frac{1}{L_o}*t_{on}<0.192 A
\end{equation*}
\tab As a result, we need an inductor with $3.8 mH$ inductance in order to meet criteria. This value is relatively high since our switching frequency is small. As a result, we needed to select a core with high inductance per turn square value. Using \href{https://www.mag-inc.com/getattachment/Products/Ferrite-Cores/Learn-More-about-Ferrite-Cores/Magnetics-Ferrite-Catalog-2017.pdf?lang=en-US}{this} catalog of Magnetics, \href{https://www.mag-inc.com/Media/Magnetics/Datasheets/0W44715TC.pdf}{0W44715TC} is selected as our inductor core, whose $A_L$ value is defined as $16100 nH/T^2$ at 10 kHz, which is our switching frequency. Number of turns is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    N=10^3*\sqrt\frac{L}{A_L}=10^3*\sqrt\frac{3.8 mH}{16100 nH}=15.36 \approx 16 turns
\end{equation*}
Assuming it will carry more or less same amount of current with the secondary winding of the transformer, we can choose AWG14 cable for inductor as well.Fill factor according to these selection is calculated below:
\begin{equation*}
    K_f=\frac{A_{cond}}{W_a}=\frac{2.08*16}{145}=0.230
\end{equation*}
After that, length of cable that is going to used for inductor is necessary to determine copper loss on the inductor. 

\begin{equation*}
    MLT=(A-B)+2C=49.9 mm
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    P_{copper}=I^2R=4.8^2*8.282*16*49.9*10^{-6}=317 mW
\end{equation*}
\tab To find core losses, Steinmetz's Equation is used once more.  According to that, core loss is calculated below:
\begin{equation*}
    P_{core}=V_e*a*B^b*f^c=16.063*10^{-3}*31.320*0.3^{1.585}*40^1.371=44.26 mW
\end{equation*}
